## Motivation
I [built this](https://subhoghosh.com/blog/first-extension/) extension to save myself from all the targeted bombardments while
still using the original platforms. Give it a try, I'm sure it'll save you hours as it has mine.

## Usage
The extension is not hosted on [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/) yet, if enough people are interested I'll do it.

> [!NOTE]
> This extension will not work on firefox as it uses the [URL Pattern API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API). If you want to make it work, contributions are welcome.

Here's how to install it manually:

1. Clone the repo (or [download](https://github.com/subhoghoshX/Dhyan/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) it and extract locally)
```
git clone https://github.com/subhoghoshX/Dhyan.git
```

2. Visit the extension management page of your browser. In case of Chrome it's
[chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and [brave://extensions/](brave://extensions/)
for Brave.

3. Enable the developer mode at the top-right corner

4. Then click on the "Load unpacked" button at the top-left corner, and browse
to the folder where the extension was cloned in your file browser to select it.
Alternatively You may also drag and drop the extension folder at the extension
management page.
