# Dhyan - zen mode for the web
Dhyan (meaning focus) is a browser extension that eliminates distracting elements
from websites that can pull you into the rabbit hole, wasting hours of your precious
time.

## Motivation
I get easily distracted by all the targeted contents on platforms like YouTube
and Twitter and waste a LOT of time. I experimented with using different tricks
and clients (like [Invidious](https://invidious.io/)) and they did a great job.
But often these third party clients are either down or black listed by the
original platform. And they often miss useful features as well.

I built this extension to save myself from all the targetted bombardments while
using the origin platforms. Give it a try, I'm sure it'll save hours of your time
as it has mine.
