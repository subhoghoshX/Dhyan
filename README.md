# Dhyan - zen mode for the web
Dhyan (meaning focus) is a browser extension that eliminates distracting elements
from websites that can pull you into the rabbit hole, wasting hours of your precious
time.

## Motivation
I often get distracted by recommendations and targeted contents on platforms like
YouTube and Twitter and waste a LOT of time. I experimented with using different
tricks and clients (like [Invidious](https://invidious.io/)) and they did a great
job. But often these third party clients are either down or black listed by the
original platform. And they usually miss useful features as well.

I built this extension to save myself from all the targeted bombardments while
still using the original platforms. Give it a try, I'm sure it'll save you hours
as it has mine.

## Usage
The extension is not hosted on any web stores yet (e.g. [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/))
because I need to pay to host. But if enough people are interested I can do it.

Here's how to install it manually:

1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/subhoghoshX/Dhyan.git
```

2. Visit the extension management page of your browser. In case of Chrome it's
[chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and [brave://extensions/](brave://extensions/)
for Brave.

3. Enable the developer mode at the top-right corner

4. Then click on the "Load unpacked" button at the top-left corner, and browse
to the folder where the extension was cloned in your file browser to select it.
Alternatively You may also drag and drop the extension folder at the extension
management page.
